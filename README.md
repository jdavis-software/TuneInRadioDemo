### Notable Feature

Multi-param filtering, which can filter the Radio Stations by - search value, favorites, and category. 

### Project Notes

While browsing [tuneinradio.com] I noticed the multi-param search feature re-painted everytime a param was added. I figured I would spend most the time building a better more performant multi-search feature providing a real-world use case, and code that you guys could actually use.

>Although I didn't build a "stations recommendations" feature, it would be simple enough to just save the station tags/categories that the user listen to and then >weight the categories/tags based on how long the user listened to each station, then recommend other stations with those tags and filter the categories by time >listened.

### Feature Enhancements

I actually spend alot of time reading about some of the new [Web Audio API],[Streams API],[Service Worker API], I was very interested in these and thought of some of cool features that could be built out.

- Audio Visualizations
- Ads (Audio & Video)
- Audio Decoding 
- Compression
- Filtering
